## 🔍 Overview

This project focused on the design and development of a patient-specific wearable hand orthosis integrating embedded pressure sensors for continuous monitoring and feedback. The system aims to improve functional support while enabling quantitative assessment of interface pressures in rehabilitation and assistive scenarios.

The work combined biomechanical design, additive manufacturing, embedded sensing, and regulatory-oriented risk analysis aligned with MDR expectations.

## ❗ Problem

Conventional hand orthoses often:

* lack patient-specific geometry
* provide limited quantitative feedback
* create pressure hotspots and discomfort
* offer minimal continuous monitoring capability

There is a need for **customizable, sensor-enabled wearable orthoses** that improve both comfort and clinical insight.
